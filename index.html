            <p class="section-text">
                I am Hikmal Dwi Saputra, a Diploma 3 graduate in Computer and Control Engineering from Politeknik Negeri
                Madiun, with a GPA of 3.75/4.00. I have a strong interest in automation systems, control systems,
                Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and software engineering, particularly
                in machine learning, as well as web and mobile application development. I am passionate about
                continuously growing in the rapidly evolving technology landscape.
                During my studies, I developed expertise in microcontrollers, IoT programming, image processing,
                embedded systems, PLC, pneumatics, and website development. I also gained hands-on experience operating
                supporting equipment such as PLCs, 3D printers, and laser cutting machines. My final project focused on
                designing and building a 3D printer with a Dual Z-Axis and CoreXY motion mechanism, equipped with a
                fixed bed system. I was responsible for the 3D design, mechanical assembly, and electronic system
                integration.
                Beyond academics, I actively participated in student organizations, contributing to information
                management, publications, social media management, and visual design for organizational programs.
                I also completed an internship at PT. Rekaindo Global Jasa as a Quality Control intern. During the
                internship, I conducted quality control inspections for luxury seats, running text systems, and various
                lighting components used in the Railway 612 project.
                With this background, I bring a strong combination of technical expertise and practical experience in
                automation, IoT, machine learning, and software development (web and mobile). I am adaptable, capable of
                working independently or in a team, and always enthusiastic about taking on new challenges. I am
                confident that my academic, organizational, and professional experiences have prepared me to contribute
                to research, development, and technological implementation in both industrial and academic environments.

                        <p>During my internship, I was responsible for conducting quality inspections on the running
                            text system of the Train 612 project and assisting with its electronic wiring process. I
                            also checked control panel connections to ensure proper system functionality. In addition, I
                            inspected newly arrived items in the incoming unit and performed quality checks and wiring
                            assistance for luxury train seats. Furthermore, I handled the repair of various train
                            components, including audio systems, running text displays, and other electronic devices to
                            ensure optimal performance.</p>

                            also prepared and optimized students’ final project technical documentation to ensure
                            clarity, structure, and compliance with academic standards.</p>

                            the mechanical and electrical systems of the tool. I created a 3D design of the tool and
                            then converted it into a ready-to-use tool. For this tool, I used a CoreXY motion mechanical
                            system, Dual Z Axis, and also a Fixed Bed system on the print base.</p>

                        <h3>YOLOv8-based overdimension and overload detection system for trucks</h3>
                        <p>I developed an Over Dimension Detection System for trucks based on Computer Vision and Deep
                            Learning as a solution to assist in monitoring ODOL vehicles. This system uses YOLOv8,
                            OpenCV, and Python to detect truck loads in real-time and calculate the length and height of
                            the load based on camera calibration. The model was trained using a dataset that was
                            collected and labeled independently, then went through a preprocessing and augmentation
                            process to improve accuracy. The system output displays the vehicle status (Normal or Over
                            Dimension) along with the load dimension measurements automatically. This project integrates
                            image processing, object detection, and digital measurement systems into one applicable
                            solution to improve the safety of freight transportation.</p>
